        <li>High cost of Implementation</li>
        <p>Setting up AI-based machines, computers, etc. entails huge costs
		given the complexity of engineering that goes into building one.
          These AI-based software programs require frequent upgrades 
		  in order to cater to the requirements of the changing environment
          as the machine needs to become smarter by the day.
          In case the software suffers a severe breakdown,
		  then the process of recovering lost codes and reinstalling the system required huge
           time and cost involved.</p>
           <li>Can't Replace Humans</li>
           <p>It is beyond any doubt that machines perform much more
		   efficiently as compared to a human being. But even then it is
              practically impossible to replace humans with AIs, 
			  at least in the near future, because you can’t build human intelligence
               in a machine as it is a gift of nature. So,
			   no matter how smart a machine can become, it can never replace a human.</p>
<li>Doesn't Improve with experience</li>
<p>One of the most amazing characteristics of human cognitive power is its ability to develop with age and experience. However, the same
   can’t be said about AIs as they are machines that can’t improve with experience, rather it starts to wear and tear with time.</p>
<li>Lacks Creativity</li>
<p>AIs are not built for creative pieces of work. So, it should be crystal clear by now that creativity or imagination is not the forte
  of the AIs. Although they can help you in designing and creating something special, they still can’t compete with the human brain.
  Their creativity is limited to the creative ability of the person who programs and commands them.</p>
  <li>Risk of Uneployment</li>
  <p>With rapid development being made in the field of AI,AIs are likely to take over the majority of the repetitive tasks, which are
    largely binary in nature and involve minimum subjectivity.</p>
